Although we will use only  the training dataset in this tutorial, a normal workflow would also use a test dataset for assessing the efficacy (accuracy, fairness, etc.) during the development of a machine learning model.  Finally, we set two variables (to be used in Step 3) for the privileged (1) and unprivileged (0) values for the race attribute.  These are key inputs for detecting and mitigating bias, which will be Step 3 and Step 4.  "
